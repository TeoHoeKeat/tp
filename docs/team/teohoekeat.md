## Project: AddressBook Level 3

**Dictionote** is a desktop application that helps CS2103T students in finding information about the module's materials and writing notes about them. It is optimised for Command Line Interface (CLI) users so that searching and writing operations can be done quickly by typing in commands.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to open and close UI panel
  * What it does: allows the user to change the UI panel visiablility via command
  * Justification: In.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.2`,`v1.3` (2 releases) on GitHub

  * Updated the List GUI scheme for list view (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

  * Developer Guide:
